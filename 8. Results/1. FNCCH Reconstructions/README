Note:

> link_1.txt reports uni-directional links with format:
    i j tau* Cij(tau*)
    where i < j and Cij(tau*) has mean subtracted (normalized)
    if tau* > 0, we infer that a link points from i -> j

> link_2.txt reports bi-directional links with format:
    i j tau*(>0) Cij(tau*) tau*(<0) Cij(tau*)
    where i < j and Cij(tau*) has mean subtracted (normalized)
