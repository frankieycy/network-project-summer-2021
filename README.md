## Neuronal Network Modeling

* Folder 1 contains the reports and presentation slides.

* Folders 2-6 contain codes relevant to network models and reconstruction techniques.

    - Each folder is a self-contained collection of codes, including libraries and/or example files. The example files represent minimal working examples which can be run directly, for example, in the terminal via: `python Example-file-name.py`. The examples by no means demonstrate all functionalities of the libraries but only the core ones.

    - They are all written in Python, and the packages required include: *numpy, scipy, sklearn, matplotlib, pycorrelate, tqdm*. For the specific instructions, refer to README inside the folders.

* Folder 7 contains coupling strength and spike timestamp data used over the project.
