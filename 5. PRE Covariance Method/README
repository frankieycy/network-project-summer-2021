#### Quick Guide to use covMethod.py ####

covMethod.py estimates the information matrix Qij based on time-lagged noise-induced covariance matrix Mij. Gaussian mixture model is applied to each column of Mij for a two-group classification and entries significantly non-zero are inferred as a network link.

Required inputs:
- states matrix: each row as the state time series of a node
- tau: physical time that each time step in time series corresponds to

Python libraries required:
- tqdm
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy
- sklearn
